## Tell us about the new integration you’d like to have
* Which source and which destination?
* Do you need a specific version of the underlying data source e.g: you specifically need support for an older version of the API or DB? 

## Describe the context around this new integration
* Which team in your company wants this integration, what for? This helps us understand the use case.
* How often do you want to run syncs?
* If this is an API source connector, which entities/endpoints do you need supported?

## Describe the alternative you are considering or using
What are you considering doing if you don’t have this integration through Airbyte?

## Are you willing to submit a PR?
<!--- 
We accept contributions! 
We just released the Airbyte Python Connector Development Framework (CDK)!
This tool simplify a lot to build a new source connector. 
If you know Python can be a good way to help us adding a new connector.
You can enter the #airbyte_cdk Slack channel to get more information about this and
there we'll help you building your connector!

Don't feel pressured in any way.
We understand if you can't submit a PR and we're tremendously grateful
that you've already contributed by suggesting a new integration.
