### Hooking up a custom dbt project to Airbyte syncs

After replication of data from a source connector (Extract) to a destination connector (Load), multiple optional transformations steps can now be applied as part of an Airbyte Sync. Possible transformations are:

1. Basic normalization transformations as automatically generated by Airbyte dbt code generator.
2. Customized normalization transformations as edited by the user (and disable the default generated normalization one)
3. Customized business transformations as specified by the user.

Let's connect my mono-repo Business Intelligence project stored in a private github git repository to update the related tables and dashboards when my Airbyte syncs completes.

Note that if you need to connect to a private git repository, one of the recommended way is to generate `Private Access Tokens` that can be used instead of a password. Then, you'd be able to include the credentials in the git repository url:

- [GitHub - Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- [Gitlab - Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)

And then use it for cloning:

    git clone https://username:token@github.com/user/repo

Where `https://username:token@github.com/user/repo` is the git repository url.

Since I am using a mono-repo from my organisation and other people/team/department may also contribute their dbt models in this centralized location too, we may end up with many dbt models and sources to build our complete data warehouse...

The whole warehouse is scheduled for full refresh on a different orchestration tool, or as part of the git repository CI. However, here, I want to partially refresh some small relevant tables when attaching this operation to a specific Airbyte sync, in this case, the covid dataset.

Therefore, I can restrict the execution of models to a particular tag or folder by specifying in the dbt cli arguments, in this case whatever is related to "covid_api":

    run --models tag:covid_api opendata.base.*
